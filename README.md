# Doordash Delivery-Time Prediction Using Machine Learning
### By: Abigail Chen, Simran Kaur, Sofia Luong, Xinchen Li
This project was successfully implemented as part of the UCLA Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) Program during Summer 2025. We worked with a dataset from Kaggle, did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), comprehensive data processing (including removing outliers, normalizing values, data imputation, etc) and feature engineering. We then implemented/evaluated multiple supervised and unsupervised ML models trying different hyper-parameters and selected the optimal one using various performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, Elbow method, etc.
