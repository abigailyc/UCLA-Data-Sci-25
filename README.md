Predictor Columns: Decide through variable selection (write code) --> will be different for each model
Target Column: total_seconds

* Make sure to use data_cleaned, and if you want to further clean the data set, make a copy of the df first (.copy())
* Use MSE for now as the metric

To Do:
--
* Simran:
    ✔️ Create total_seconds column using feature engineering 
    - KNN Model (feature selection + K-fold CV)
* Sofia:
    - Decision Tree/Random Forest Regression Model (feature selection + K-fold CV)
* Xinchen:
    - Linear Regression Model (feature selection + K-fold CV)
* Abigail:
    - Logistic Regression Model (feature selection + K-fold CV)

 
Any other models??
